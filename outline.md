# Basic Techniques

* Don't set maximum-scale, minimum-scale, and user-scalable

## Create Your Fluid Grid

* target / context = result

## CSS Media Queries

# Advanced Techniques

## Images

### <picture> Element

* <picture> element works much like <video> and <audio> elements
* Uses built-in media queries to determine proper image for the viewport
* Includes an <img> fallback for older browsers
* Not supported in any browser yet
* Picturefill is a JavaScript tool that mimics the <picture> element

### srcset Attribute

* srcset is a new attribute for the <img> element
* Contains multiple images with targeted media queries
* Syntax is unintuitive
* Implemented in WebKit nightly builds

### Responsive JPEGs

* Progressive
* High compression, 2.2x Size

### Warning for Images in WordPress

* WordPress likes to use "width" and "height" attributes
* To override these, use "width" and "max-width" CSS properties
* **Always** set `height: auto;` or your images will be distorted

### Icon Fonts

* Don't use images if you don't have to
* Icon fonts offer alternatives that are scalable, colorable, work with shadows
* Genericons: built by Automattic & used in Twenty Thirteen

## Layout

### box-sizing: border-box;

```
*, *:after, *:before {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Flexbox

* Support is increasing


## CSS Preprocessors

* Almost an essential tool for responsive design
* Variables, functions, mixins
* Media query bubbling

## Miscellany
